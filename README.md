c-language-nonsense
===================

Some of my first ventures into computer programming.

All in C language.

Nothing here is profound or of great quality, though some of it might be interesting to look at.

A few of the more interesting items:

- A program which implemented an encryption algorithm similar to the enigma machine form WWII.
- Matrix inversion (though a sane person doesn't usually explicity invert a matrix).
- A benchmark based on math instructions.
- A program to make my physical homework less painful by automating the calculation of significant figures.
