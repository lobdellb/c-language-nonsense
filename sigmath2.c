{"	Jesus replied, \"I am the bread of life.  No one\n\
who comes to me will ever be hungry again.  Those who\n\
believe in me will never thirst.  But you haven't\n\
believed in me even though you have seen me.  However,\n\
those the Father has given me will come to me, and I\n\
will never reject them.  For I have come down from\n\
heaven to do the will of God who sent me, not to do\n\
what I want.  And this is the will of God, that I\n\
should not lose even one of all those he has given me,\n\
but that I should raise them to eternal life at the\n\
last day.  For it is my Father's will that all who see\n\
his Son and believe in him should have eternal - that I\n\
should raise them at the last day.\"  (John 6:35-40)\n"};
